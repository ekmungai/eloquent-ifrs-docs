### Model vs Transaction namespace
 The Classes in the `IFRS\Transactions` extend the Transaction class in the `IFRS\Models` namespace and have validation specific to their types to enforce IFRS classification rules. For example, the main account for a `CashSale` transaction must be of type `Account::BANK`.

 Whereas it is possible to create transactions directly from the model, this is not recommended as it would bypass the validation logic.

### Attributes
+ `account_id`: This Id of the Main Account of the Transaction. This account will get the total amount of the transaction posted to it.
+ `date`: The Date(time) of the transaction
+ `narration`: A short description of the purpose of the transaction.
+ `currency_id`: The Id of the currency of the transaction, defaults to the reporting currency of the logged in user's entity.
+ `exchange_rate_id`: The Id of the rate of exchange between the reporting currency and the transaction currency valid at the time the transaction was made. Defaults to `1.00 
+ `reference`: Optional further idenitifying information about the transaction. For example the LPO Number for a Client Invoice. Defaults to `null`.
+ `transaction_no`: The transaction number of the transaction. Defaults to a serially generated number of the form `TTYY/XXXXX`, where `TT` represents the transaction type, `YY` is the period count for the reporting period in which the transaction date falls, and `XXXXX`is a zero padded count of previously recorded transactions of the same type.
+ `transaction_type`: The two character string representing the transaction type as defined by the Transaction class. (See [Constants]({{< relref "#constants" >}})).
+ `credited`: A boolean indicating whether the transaction should be posted in the credit side of the main account.
+ `entity_id`: The Id of the entity associated with the transaction. Defaults to the id of entity of the logged in user.

NB: A transaction is not posted to the Ledger when it is saved. It still has only one side of the double entry and so it requires Line Items to be added to it before it can be posted. (See [Line Items]({{< relref "line-items.md" >}})).

### Relations
+ `$transaction->entity:` The entity associated with the transaction. 
+ `$transaction->ledgers:` The Ledger objects associated with the transaction. 
+ `$transaction->currency:` The transaction's currency. 
+ `$transaction->account:` The transaction's main account. 
+ `$transaction->exchangeRate:` The transaction's exchange rate. 
+ `$transaction->assignments:` Transactions that have been cleared by (assigned to) this transaction. 
+ `$transaction->clearances:` Transactions that have been cleared by this transaction. 
+ `$transaction->lineItems:` The LineItem objects associated with the transaction. 

### Methods
+ `Transaction::transactionNo($type, $date):` Gets the next transaction number for the given the `$type`and the reporting period within which `$date` falls. 
+ `Transaction::getType($type):` The human readable type name of the given transaction type. 
+ `Transaction::getTypes($types):` The human readable type names of the transaction types in the given array. 
+ `$transaction->isPosted():` Returns a boolean indicating whether the transaction has been posted to the ledger. 
+ `$transaction->isCredited():` Returns a boolean indicating whether the transaction amount was posted to the credit side of the main account.  
+ `$transaction->getClearedType():` The full name (including path) of the model. Used by the Assignment model.  
+ `$transaction->getAmount():` Returns the total amount of the transaction. 
+ `$transaction->getLineItems():` Retrieves LineItem objects associated with the transaction and loads them to its items array. 
+ `$transaction->addLineItem():` Adds a LineItem object to the transaction's items array. 
+ `$transaction->removeLineItem():` Removes a LineItem object from the transaction's items array and dissociates it from the transaction. 
+ `$transaction->post():` Saves all LineItem objects in the transaction's items array, associating them with the transaction and creating the Ledger objects for the transaction. 
+ `$transaction->checkIntegrity():` Confirms that all Ledger objects for the transaction have not been altered. 
+ `$transaction->attributes():` Presents the transactions's attributes as an object. Useful for debugging.
