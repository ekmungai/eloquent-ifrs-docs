This package is designed to provide an accounting subsystem to your Laravel application or Lumen API, allowing you to passively record all financial transactions generated by the operation of the parent application in a format compatible with IFRS. It eliminates the need for extracting data from your application to load it in an external financial system for the purpose of reporting.
